## Specifications:
The code for day X is fully contained in X.py. The solutions can be obtained by running first() and second() respectively.

My input data for day X (as given by the website) is contained in ./data/X.txt.

The most difficult problems were (in my humble opinion):
Day 19: Beacon Scanner 
Day 23: Amphipod
Day 19 was really just an incredibly difficult problem, whereas Day 23 was very fiddly.

Honorable mentions go to Day 22: Reactor Reboot, which can be remarkably difficult if you don't see a certain clever trick, and Day 8: Seven Segment Search, which I—even though it wasn't that difficult—did not solve on the 8th day, since I tried to be far too clever with my first solution.

Out of these problems all were solved on their respective days, except:
Day 8, part 2
Day 23
Day 24
Day 25
