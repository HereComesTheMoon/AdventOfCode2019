Specifications:
The code for day X is fully contained in X.py. The solutions can be obtained by running first(), and second() respectively.
The input data for day X is contained in ./data/X.csv.
The ".csv" extension is (quite frequently) entirely incorrect. I am using it since I used it for the first few days, and for the consistency.

Day 8 was not solved until way laterâ€”tried to be way too clever the first time.
