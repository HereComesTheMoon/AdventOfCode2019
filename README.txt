Specifications:
The code for day X is fully contained in X.py. The solutions can be obtained by running first(), and second() respectively.

My input data for day X is contained in ./data/X.csv.

These files really should not have .csv extensions. For the uninitiated: Comma-Separated Value files are essentially text files, whose lines are rows in a simple spreadsheet, and whose cells are ceparated by commas. Throughout the challenge I used the bash command 'sed' to format my input datasets as csv-files. I eventually changed this to ensure that the Python-files are completely self-contained, and don't require any additional formatting of the data. The name stuck, though.

The most difficult problems were (in my humble opinion):
Day 19: Beacon Scanner 
Day 23: Amphipod
Day 19 was just very difficult, whereas Day 23 was very fiddly. 

Honorable mentions go to Day 22: Reactor Reboot, which can be remarkably difficult if you don't see a certain clever trick, and Day 8: Seven Segment Search, which is not that difficult (just quite fiddly), and which I didn't solve until later since I tried to be way too clever the first time.

Out of these problems all were solved on their respective days, except:
Day 8, part 2
Day 23
Day 24
Day 25
